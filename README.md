## Avida Towers

Testing out my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills by building this static site from scratch. This was supposed to be a site for one of my classmates, which I actually designed in Photoshop but never got to convert it to a webpage because the project didn't push through. Would love to blog how I built this once I get my site up and running.

Updates to be posted soon! Yay!
